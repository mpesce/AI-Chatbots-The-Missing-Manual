<h1>Demystifying & Harnessing ChatGPT, Bing & Bard</h1>  
<h1>The Missing Manual</h1>

  

<h2>Summary</h2>

  

Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are the most important innovation in computing since the World Wide Web. Already the fastest growing app in history, ChatGPT has now become something hundreds of millions use every day - yet few have mastered the art of ‘sweet-talking’ ChatGPT into providing detailed and accurate responses to ‘prompts’.

  

This book takes the reader on a journey through the ‘big three’ AI chatbots - OpenAI ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing and Google Bard - demystifies their operation, then provides a wealth of ‘tools for thinking’ about how to make these new tools work. Rather than a do-this, do-that text of prompts, this book helps people into understanding, engaging their minds and their imaginations, as they learn how to experiment and get comfortable with this next new age of computing.

<h2>Main objectives</h2>

  

A reader should come away from this book with an understanding of how to use the ‘big three’ AI chatbots; core skills in constructing basic ‘zero-shot’ prompts to answer research questions and summarise documents; use storytelling skills to craft more complex zero-shot prompts, develop examples for ‘few-shot prompts’; how to detect when chatbots fabricate answers - and what to do when a chatbot refuses to comply with a prompt. Most of all, the reader will learn ‘how to think’ in a new age of linguistically-oriented interfaces to computers - a skill that will stand them in good stead even as these technologies rapidly evolve.

  

<h2>Why you should read this</h2>

  

ChatGPT is the most important technology of this generation - but hardly anyone knows how to write great prompts that ‘sweet talk’ ChatGPT into generating compelling responses. This book will show you how - by teaching you how to tell compelling stories to ChatGPT.

  
  

<h2>5 key  points</h2>

  

-   Everyone who touches a computer is going to need to be able to compose compelling prompts.
    
-   Even though hundreds of millions of people now use ChatGPT, very few people have those skills today.
    
-   You can google a website if you want to learn what to do - but you’ll need to read my book if you want to understand ‘how to think’ about these new AI chatbots.
    
-   At the end of 2023, Microsoft will integrate ‘Copilot’ into Windows 11. At one stroke, a half a billion PC users will require strong prompt skills, so they can make the most of this new tool. Tapping even a tiny portion of this total addressable market could lead to impressive sales.
    
-   ChatGPT is all very new, and it’s all moving very fast - so people are worried. Knowledge will help to dispel some of the fear surrounding recent advances in AI.
