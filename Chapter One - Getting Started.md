<h2>The ‘Big Three’: ChatGPT, Bing & Bard</h2>

  

Three AI Chatbots dominate the landscape. The first of these, ChatGPT, came out in December 2022 from artificial intelligence startup OpenAI. Within a few months ChatGPT had competitors, quickly brought to market by two the usual ‘big tech’ suspects - multi-trillion dollar software firms Microsoft, with its Bing Chat, and Google, with Bard.

  

Each of these chatbots offers pretty much the same service, delivered in the same way - a Web-browser based conversation with an artificial intelligence tool. In each of them, a user can type in pretty much any sort of question, request, problem, observation - even a whole scientific paper - and ask the chatbot to respond.

  

The quality and the depth of that response varies significantly among these three offerings. Some of them show hallmarks of being rushed to market, and feel a bit unfinished. The months and years ahead will see these differences smoothed out, and within a year or two all three chatbots should offer remarkably similar experiences.

  

That means it’s a good idea to know how to use all three of them, and be well prepared to use them interchangeably. There may be a situation where one is available while its alternatives are not - so it’s a useful talent to be across all of them. Just in case.

  

We’ll take them individually, starting with the first and (arguably) the best.

  

<h2>ChatGPT</h2>

  

<h3>What is it?</h3>

  

The granddaddy of AI Chatbots, ChatGPT provides a conversational interface to an artificial intelligence program.

  

It comes in two flavours: ChatGPT, which employs the older and less-capable GPT-3.5-Turbo model behind the scenes; and ChatGPT+, which offers subscription-based, priority access to ChatGPT, and employs its most capable and best-in-class GPT-4 model.

  

ChatGPT+ costs around USD $20 per month - and while you can use it as much as you like in GPT-3.5-Turbo mode, subscribers will find themselves ‘rate limited’ to 50 chat interactions every three hours when using the computationally much more intensive GPT-4.

  

Where possible, ChatGPT+ using GPT-4 is always to be preferred over ChatGPT using GPT-3.5-Turbo. The results are just that much better, becayse GPT-4 is the current gold standard. It has no peer.

  

The question is whether you want to pay for that power.

  

<h3>How do you access it?</h3>

  

ChatGPT is an app that runs in your web browser - it can be accessed at [https://chatgpt.openai.com](https://chatgpt.openai.com)

  

OpenAI also provides a ChatGPT app for mobile devices - for both iOS and Android. (iPadOS users can use the iOS app.) Those apps are available through the Apple App Store and Google Play, respectively.

  

<h3>Do I need to sign up?</h3>

  

Yes. OpenAI requires that you sign up for a free account on their website.

  

You can do that by going to the main page for OpenAI, at openai.com, accessing the menu, and selecting the ‘Sign up’ option.

Once you’ve created your account, it is attached to your ‘chat history’ with ChatGPT. This means ChatGPT can ‘remember’ all of the chat sessions you’ve had with it, which allows you to go back to any of them, revew them, download them - even revise them and have another go with ChatGPT.

  

<h3>How do I use ChatGPT?</h3>

  

Basically, you type whatever you like in the “prompt” area at the bottom of the web page. ChatGPT will respond above - and will show your ‘prompt’ above its response.

  

This truly is a conversation; you can pick up on any point made by ChatGPT in its response, ask it to expand upon, defend, or provide additional examples of any of its replies.

  

Managing that conversation well, using ‘prompts’ - that’s the rest of this book.

  
  

<h2>Microsoft Bing Chat</h2>

  

<h3>What is it?</h3>

  

Just a few months after ChatGPT launched, Microsoft launched its own Bing Chat. Microsoft was able to come to market so quickly largely due to a massive, ongoing investment in OpenAI, giving the tech giant access to OpenAI technologies such as GPT-3 and GPT-4, which they quickly built into their own AI chatbot.

  

Microsoft’s Bing Chat is true hybrid: Microsoft had been working on a variety of AI chatbots for almost a decade, and blended its own experiences with chatbots with the capabilities provided by OpenAI’s GPT-3 and GPT-4. This gives Bing Chat a distinctly different ‘personality’ than ChatGPT, even though they are built upon exactly the same foundations.

  

<h3>How do you access it?</h3>

  

Microsoft wants to encourage everyone to use their new web browser, Edge, so they’ve built Bing Chat into Edge Browser. In the upper right hand corner of the browser window, there’s a “dialog bubble” with a blue “B” inside of it. That’s the icon representing Bing Chat. Click on that bubble, and as much as half of the right side of the browser window will become Bing Chat. To close Bing Chat, simply type on the “B” again.

Microsoft has also released Bing Chat mobile apps for iOS and Android.

  

<h3>Do I need to sign up?</h3>

  

Yes. Everyone using a Microsoft operating system (or other product, such as Office, Office 365, Business Intelligence, etc.) will already have a login - either personal or through your organisation - at Microsoft.com. If you don’t have already have a microsoft login, go to Microsoft.com and sign up.

  

<h3>How do I use Bing Chat?</h3>

  

Although Bing Chat operates very similarly to ChatGPT, there is one significant difference: rather than choosing GPT-3-Turbo or GPT-4 as the artificial intelligence model used in conversation, you’re presented with three ‘style’ options: “More creative”, “More balanced” and “More precise”. Selecting either “More creative” or “More Precise” forces Bing Chat to use GPT-4 for its responses, while “More balanced” uses the simpler and faster GPT-3-Turbo model.

  

That style choice is not permanent: you can ‘reset’ the conversation by selecting at item from the drop down menu in the upper right hand corner of the Bing Chat window, and at the start of every new interaction with Bing Chat you will have to set the style.

Once you’ve made your choice, as with ChatGPT, you type whatever you like in the “prompt” area at the bottom of the Bing Chat window. Bing Chat will respond above - and will show your ‘prompt’ above its response.

  

Again, this is truly is a conversation; you can pick up on any point made by Bing Chat in its response, ask it to expand upon, defend, or provide additional examples of any of its replies. But that said, Bing Chat tends to limit the number of back-and-forths in any conversation. After that limit is reached, Bing Chat will ask you to initiate a new conversation.

  
  

<h2>Google Bard</h2>

  

<h3>What is it?</h3>

  

As the inventor of the modern technology underlying all AI Chatbots - a 2017 paper by Google researchers made these ‘Large Language Models’ possible - Google was surprisingly caught out by the arrival, quality and success of ChatGPT. Ever since that happened, Google has been playing catch up, launching its own ‘Bard’ Chatbot in May of 2023.

  

Like ChatGPT and Bing Chat, Google Bard provides a conversational interface to an artificial intelligence program. In Google’s case, that program is known as PaLM-2, its second-generation artificial intelligence model.

  

Many users find Bard the most ‘bland’ of the Big Three chatbots. While ChatGPT can be warm and friendly, Bing can be almost too helpful, Bard comes across as entirely neutral.

  

<h3>How do you access it?</h3>

  

Google Bard is available via a web page at [https://bard.google.com/](https://bard.google.com/). Just point your browser there.

  

At this point there are no mobile apps for Bard on either iOS or Android.

  

<h3>Do I need to sign up?</h3>

  

Yes. You’ll need a Google login to use Bard. However, almost everyone who uses any of Google’s service - such as Google Calendar, Google Mail, Google Documents, Google Sheets, etc. - already has a Google account.

  

If you need a Google account, visit the Google home page, click on the button that says, “Sign in”, then follow the instructions for setting up an account.

  

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>

  

Type whatever you like in the “Enter a prompt here” area at the bottom of the web page, then hit Enter. Bard will respond above - and will show your ‘prompt’ above its response.

  

This truly is a conversation; you can pick up on any point made by Bard in its response, ask it to expand upon, defend, or provide additional examples of any of its replies.

  

Like ChatGPT, Bard also maintains a memory of all of its other chat sessions - you can access those from the bar running up the left side of Bard’s web page.
